# Spring Boot E-commerce Backend

## Description

This project is the backend for an e-commerce application, built using Spring Boot. It provides RESTful APIs for managing products, categories, customer data, orders, and more. It leverages Spring Data REST to rapidly expose HATEOAS-compliant endpoints for core entities.

## Features

*   **Product Catalog Management:**
    *   CRUD operations for Products.
    *   CRUD operations for Product Categories.
    *   Search products by category.
*   **Customer Management:**
    *   CRUD operations for Customers.
*   **Order Processing:**
    *   Endpoint for placing customer orders (checkout).
    *   (Potentially) Order history for customers.
*   **Geographical Data:**
    *   CRUD operations for Countries.
    *   CRUD operations for States (often linked to Countries).
*   **RESTful API:**
    *   Automatic HATEOAS-compliant REST endpoints for entities managed by Spring Data REST (e.g., `Country`, `State`, `ProductCategory`).
    *   Custom endpoints for specific business logic (e.g., checkout).

## Technologies Used

*   **Java** (Specify your version, e.g., Java 17)
*   **Spring Boot** (Specify your version)
    *   Spring Web: For building RESTful APIs.
    *   Spring Data JPA: For data persistence.
    *   Spring Data REST: For automatically exposing JPA repositories as REST endpoints.
    *   Spring Boot DevTools: For enhanced development experience.
*   **Hibernate:** As the JPA provider.
*   **Database:** (Specify your database, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
*   **Maven:** As the build and dependency management tool.
*   **Lombok:** To reduce boilerplate code.

## API Endpoints

This application exposes several REST endpoints. Many are automatically generated by Spring Data REST for entities annotated with `@RepositoryRestResource`.

### Auto-generated by Spring Data REST (Examples)

Assuming entities like `Product`, `ProductCategory`, `Country`, `State` are exposed via `@RepositoryRestResource`:

*   **Products:**
    *   `GET /api/products`: List all products (supports pagination and sorting).
    *   `GET /api/products/{id}`: Get a specific product.
    *   `POST /api/products`: Create a new product.
    *   `PUT /api/products/{id}`: Update a product.
    *   `DELETE /api/products/{id}`: Delete a product.
    *   `GET /api/products/search/findByCategoryId?id={categoryId}`: Find products by category ID.
*   **Product Categories:**
    *   `GET /api/product-category`: List all product categories.
    *   `GET /api/product-category/{id}`: Get a specific product category.
    *   `GET /api/product-category/{id}/products`: Get products associated with a category.
*   **Countries:**
    *   `GET /api/countries`: List all countries.
    *   `GET /api/countries/{id}`: Get a specific country.
    *   `GET /api/countries/{id}/states`: Get states associated with a country.
*   **States:**
    *   `GET /api/states`: List all states.
    *   `GET /api/states/search/findByCountryCode?code={countryCode}`: Find states by country code.

*(Note: The exact paths like `/api/products` depend on the `path` and `collectionResourceRel` attributes in `@RepositoryRestResource` and your `spring.data.rest.base-path` configuration in `application.properties`.)*

### Custom Endpoints

*   **Checkout:**
    *   `POST /api/checkout/purchase`: Endpoint to process a customer's purchase.
        *   Request Body: A JSON object representing the purchase, including customer details, shipping/billing addresses, and order items.
        *   Example:
