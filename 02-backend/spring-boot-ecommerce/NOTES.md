## @RepositoryRestResource (Spring Data REST)

*   **Primary Goal:** Rapidly expose Spring Data repositories as RESTful, HATEOAS-compliant APIs.
*   **HATEOAS:** Yes, typically uses HAL (Hypertext Application Language) for links.
*   **Standardization:** Spring ecosystem-specific, follows general REST principles.
*   **Query Language:**
    *   Basic CRUD operations.
    *   Pagination and sorting.
    *   Custom repository query methods exposed as search endpoints.
    *   Querying via path segments and request parameters.
*   **Metadata:** Exposes ALPS or JSON Schema for service discovery.
*   **Payload Formats:** Primarily JSON (HAL).
*   **Ease of Use (Spring):** Very high; minimal configuration if using Spring Data.
*   **Client Ecosystem:** General REST clients.
*   **Typical Use Case:** Quickly creating REST APIs for Spring Data entities within a Spring application.

## OData (Open Data Protocol)

*   **Primary Goal:** Provide a standardized protocol for building and consuming data APIs.
*   **HATEOAS:** Yes, provides links for navigation and actions within its defined formats.
*   **Standardization:** OASIS standard, providing a formal specification.
*   **Query Language:**
    *   Rich, standardized query language in URL.
    *   Supports operators like `$filter`, `$select`, `$expand`, `$orderby`, `$top`, `$skip`.
*   **Metadata:** Provides a comprehensive service document (`$metadata`) describing the Entity Data Model (EDM) in CSDL (Conceptual Schema Definition Language).
*   **Payload Formats:** JSON (with OData-specific annotations), Atom/XML.
*   **Ease of Use (Spring):** Requires integrating an OData library (e.g., Apache Olingo); more setup compared to Spring Data REST.
*   **Client Ecosystem:** Broader ecosystem of client libraries and tools that understand OData specifically (e.g., BI tools, Salesforce, SAP).
*   **Typical Use Case:** Enterprise scenarios, complex data querying needs, integration with tools supporting OData.
